# Abstract Data Types in C

This respository contains specifications and implementations for several abstract data types in C, namely:

- ADT Complex (mathematical);
- ADT Stack (collection);
- ADT Queue (collection);
- ADT List (collection);
- ADT Map (collection);
- ADT BinarySearchTree (collection);

Implementations using different *linear data structures*, namely *arrays* and *linked lists* are included for some ADTs.

## Structure

Each ADT is provided in its own directory.

### Documentation

Each ADT specification and files are documented with *doxygen* format.

### Compiling

You can make use of the supplied `makefile` for each directory.

## Contributing

You can fork this project or submit a pull request. Pull requests should adhere to the existing naming and *doxygen* conventions.

You can provide different implementations for the existing ADTs and/or contribute with other ADTs.
